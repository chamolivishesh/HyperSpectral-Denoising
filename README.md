# HyperSpectral-Denoising
Denoisning a HyperSpectral Signal using the concept of Thresholding

Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. The aim of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes.
Here, my attempt with this repository is to take one single signal and denoise it assuming it got noisy during transmission and the noisy part is removed from the output
